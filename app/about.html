                        <br>
                        <p>Music had its beginning in a small retail store selling disc. Founder Touhar Fang, Cheenou Lee, and Steven Lee had creative ideas about how they could supply more music to respond to people who love listening to music at the tip of their finger. Then, the Music site was born.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The original focus was simple, offer the highest quality music at the lowest possible prices, supported by an extraordinary level of service. 
                           Today, youâ€˜ll find that focus has not changed.</p>

                            At Music, good customer service also includes having the most recent music on hand when the newest albums are released.</p>
